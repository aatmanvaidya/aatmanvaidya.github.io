I am a Research Engineer at [Tattle](https://tattle.co.in/), where I contribute to building citizen centric open-source tools and datasets to understand and respond to online harms and abuse in India.

I work at the intersection of <u>language</u>, <u>technology</u> and <u>society</u>. My research interests broadly lie in `computational social science` and `human centered AI`, with a focus in measuring and mitigating online harms in low-resource contexts and making digital spaces safer and more inclusive.

Here are some research directions I work on:

- **Understanding spread of information on online platforms** and designing strategies to mitigate it. I particularly study how harmful content [propagates](https://aatmanvaidya.github.io/assets/papers/hate_spread_cods_comad.pdf) on social networks like Twitter, Koo and Gab. I also examine the cross-platform spread of misinformation, like how health-related misinformation and financial scams spread across platforms (ongoing work).  
- **Community-led participatory approach for online safety**. I strive to build safer and culturally well rounded AI systems that are centered on lived experiences of people at the end of online violence.. Through expert-led participatory approaches, I aim to understand the context-specific ways that harm manifests in different regions and communities. This approach has informed our development of [AI safety benchmark](https://aatmanvaidya.github.io/assets/papers/ai-safety-benchmark-dataset.pdf) dataset on hate and sex-related crimes and dataset for [online gender-based violence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09086) in India.  
- **Building user centric tools to combat online abuse**. At Tattle, I help build tools like [Uli](https://uli.tattle.co.in/), a browser plugin that redacts slurs and abusive content from your online feed; [Feluda](https://github.com/tattle-made/feluda), an engine for analysing multi-lingual and multi-modal content; [Deepfakes Analysis Unit](https://github.com/tattle-made/dau-dashboard/), a collaborative space for analyzing deepfakes and AI generated content and [Viral Spiral](https://tattle.co.in/products/viral-spiral/), a multiplayer card game about sharing news on the internet.
